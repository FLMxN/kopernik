# Kopernik - geography-adjacent ResNet-based CNN by Google Street View data
## Introduction
**Kopernik** is an open-source machine learning project, focused on predicting geographic data based on landscape pictures inside or outside of urbanity.

## Installation
### Dependencies
Kopernik mostly requires a standart package of machine learning and image processing libraries for Python >= 3.12 (including CUDA-supporting version of PyTorch and collateral) as well as CUDA-supporting GPU for training and/or inference.
```
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn datasets numpy tqdm pathlib
```
### Model setup
In order to use pretrained fine-tuned model of the latest developer version, download it via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/flmxn/resnet50-streetview/blob/main/resnet50_streetview_imagenet1k.pth)

Otherwise, to train Kopernik with your own configuration, look into [torch_trainer.py](torch_trainer.py)

Before start, make sure to insert the path to your model and sample pictures in the inference config at [torch_main.py](torch_main.py)

## Inference
### Startup
If you completed [model setup](#model-setup) properly, inference requires no any additional preparations --> launch [torch_main.py](torch_main.py) and voila!
### Output interpretation
