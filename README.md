## Installation
### Dependencies
Kopernik mostly requires a standart package of machine learning and image processing libraries for Python >= 3.12 (including CUDA-supporting version of PyTorch and collateral) as well as CUDA-supporting GPU for training and/or inference.
```
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn datasets numpy tqdm pathlib
```
### Model setup
In order to use pretrained fine-tuned model of the latest <ins>**developer version**</ins>, download it via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/flmxn/resnet50-streetview/blob/main/resnet50_streetview_imagenet1k.pth)

Otherwise, to train Kopernik with your own configuration, look into [torch_trainer.py](torch_trainer.py)

Before start, make sure to insert the path to your model and sample pictures in the inference config at [torch_main.py](torch_main.py)

## Inference
### Startup
If you completed [model setup](#model-setup) properly, inference requires no any additional preparations --> launch [torch_main.py](torch_main.py) and voila!
### Output

Effectively useless data by the date of ***Jan 09, 2026***. [Developer model](#model-setup) has loaded and processed [t2.png](pics/t2.png) with 2 different scaling strategies (stretch and crop). Coordinate-related data serves no meaning (yet).

Features of [t2.png](pics/t2.png) seem to mostly represent features of **Germany** (DE) and **Czech Republic** (CZ), followed up by **Slovenia** (SI), **Portugal** (PT) and **Andorra** (AD). All labels respect the naming standart of [**ISO 3166-1 alpha-2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).

## Understanding predictions and labels
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When working with a mathematical model, it is a common mistake to take it's predictions as-is. It is crucial to understand the meaning behind each label in a particular model architecture. [Developer model](#model-setup) is far from flawless, just as any other mathematical predictor of such nature.

To fairly estimate and interpret predictions of [this particular](#model-setup) model, let's categorize labels inside it's computing space.
+ <ins>**Null point attractors:**</ins> **New Zealand** (NZ), **Bhutan** (BH), **Eswatini** (SZ), **Cambodia** (KH) and **Argentina** (AR). These labels usually represent particular ambiguity of image features. Results, containing these labels as *top_k* are probably <ins>*invalid*</ins> and serve no meaning due to lack of images' informative features.
+ <ins>**Common attractors:**</ins>
  - **Taiwan** (TW) and **South Korea** (KR) labels represent features of developed mostly Asian countries, although certain European or American landscapes can fit into this space as well. More often than not represents large urban centres of China, India, Japan, Australia, USA and Russia.
  - **Czech Republic** (CZ) label represents features of mostly post-soviet countries, although certain Eastern European landscapes can fit into this space as well. More often than not represents rural or small urban centres of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
  - **Finland** (FI) label represents features of mostly northern countries, although certain European landscapes can fit into this space as well. More often than not represents northern medium urban centres of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland.
